# PyMP3

This is a MP3 player I'm designing in python.
This is currently a work in progress and is not yet finished.

For now, this music player will only use .wav files because pygame does not support (or is rough) with .mp3 files.

I haven't finished cross-platform support for directory file path formatting, so for now the file paths are only formatted to Linux/UNIX.

Right now the file path is set to /home/user/Downloads/ and '/user/' is your username.
